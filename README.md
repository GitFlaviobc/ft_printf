<a name="intro"/> <h2> Intro </h2> </a>
- This is the first "big" project where I need to get all the previous knowledge and recreate the printf function.
- It is an introduction to concept of "variadic function" and to some conversions.
- It makes you understand better the conversions and flags inside the original printf function.
- I decided to learn and use "functional programming", once I realized that the things are getting bigger.
- I am still learning about "functional porgramming" but I am "forcing" myself to apply it and improve my code structure.
- Once again I used other people tests but this time I started to create my own main functions and do my individual tests to find specific bugs on the code.
- *(On extreme errors caused by inputs of the user) My ft_printf can have different behaviour from original printf depending on the system.

<a name="goal"/> <h2> 🎯 Goal </h2> </a>
- ft_printf goal is to recreate the original printf function but not all the flags.
- Conversions ```cspdiuxX%```
- Flags ```-0.*```
- Introduces new concepts of static variable and file descriptor.

<a name="how"/> <h2> 📖 How to use </h2> </a>

- Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GitFlaviobc/ft_printf.git
```
Inside the Project folder:
- to create the library
```bash
make
```
or
```bash
make all
```
- to delete all obj (.o) files created
```bash
make clean
```
 - to delete all created files
```bash
make fclean
```
 - to delete all files and recreate the library
```bash
make re
```
- After the creation of the library I can use ft_printf the same way I use the original printf. With the limitations of the conversions and flags that I did not implemented.

- Note: I didn't created any of the test, I just used them to check my project. All credit goes to their creators. <p></p>

- All tests were done on the browser connect with SSH to an iMac.

###### *42 changes the projects from time to time, and the test keep being updated to follow it. So this project may be outdated for the tests.
